# GGC

A rust-based [Gemini](https://gemini.circumlunar.space/) server.

## Building
To compile the server, ensure that you have rust installed, and then simply run `cargo build --release` to compile in release mode (or `cargo build` to compile a debug build). The resulting binary will be created in `target/release/ggc(.exe)` (or `target/debug/ggc(.exe)` for debug builds).

## What's the name mean?
It's short for [Gemini Guidance Computer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gemini_Guidance_Computer), which was the onboard computer used on the [Gemini missions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Gemini)
